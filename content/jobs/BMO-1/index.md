- Built an anomaly detection model using Isolation Forest to detect suspicious activities within Hong Kong and Singapore trade finance instruments; defined candidate variables, applied feature engineering, and established performance metrics; reduced false positives by 35%.
- Developed a supervised model aimed at identifying the likelihood of cash structuring using the CART algorithm, resulting in a 75% monthly precision.
- Designed and deployed an NLP solution for analyzing unstructured data in customer communications via P2P payment platforms (Venmo, PayPal), identifying high-risk keywords and patterns with 70% accuracy.
- Optimized existing ML pipelines by refactoring code and implementing parallel processing, reducing model training time by 60% and improving overall system performance.
- Created interactive dashboards using Python and visualization libraries to present complex model outputs to non-technical stakeholders, enhancing decision-making processes.
- Collaborated with compliance teams to ensure all ML models adhered to regulatory requirements and documented model risk management procedures.
